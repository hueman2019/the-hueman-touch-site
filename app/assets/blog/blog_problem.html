    <h1>The Problem Word</h1>
    <h3>By: HECTOR PEREZ</h3>
    <article class="">
      <h2>Problem?</h2>
      <p>I love hearing the word "problem." Something about it turns me on.</p>
      <p>It challenges my <a href="">INNER STRENGTHS</a> that build the character I yearn to continuously reinforce. I enjoy the
      growth. It's ironic, though, because I love it when other people use it to
      describe a situation they hope I can solve, yet I refuse to ever use
      the word in my vocabulary.</p>
      <p>I used to use it in my vocabulary to describe issues that needed to be
      addressed with an immediate solution. But when I began to become more aware of
      the power of language has on my way of thinking, I began to realize how limited
      my mindset and creative skills would be if I continued to use "problem" in my
      daily language.</p>
      <p>I admit I had a predominantly logical side that loves math and linear solutions, and
      so I was subconsciously accustomed to dealing with every situation in my life like a
      complex problem that would require an enormous amount of time rationalizing the best solution.</p>
      <p>But around the same time that I began to cathartically work with Human Beings, while choosing
      to shift my mindset so that I can chase my EntrepreNEURAL ventures, I began to truly understand
      the effect the word "problem" has on people and I could feel how empowered I was when I chose not to use it
      in my Life.</p>
      <p>When people used the word, especially in meetings, the echoes of the last syllable would cause even the furthest
      person across the room to fidget. I could see that if the person in charge used it, everyone felt uneasy. I also witnessed that
      when people used the word, many people would focus on the problem itself instead of actually focusing on the solution.
      This led to many complaints and discouraged ambitions to help solve whatever "problem" was announced.</p>
      <p>This leads me to share a story of a friend that went water rifting with his family down the Colorado River. He and his family
      were rifting in the waters and had planned everything out according to the weather forecast, forecasts from park rangers, and their own
      expectations. However, they ran into a troubling situation where the stream was too rough for the family to easily control. My friend, David,
      was the person in charge of the boat and of course, his family's well-being. He had two thoughts to choose from: panic and redirect his family
      to aimlessly keep their cool, OR to have everyone focus on a big rock located on the shore and to not lose sight of the rock as they rowed
      all their might towards that destination.</p>
      <p>He chose the latter and instructed everyone to look at the rock on shore and invest all their strength into rowwing towards it. Amidst the
      rough loudness and wet blurriness the waters heaved on them, the family pierced through adversity and was able to make it to shore. Park rangers
      showed up with relief as they themselves could not believe that they were able to make it through.</p>
      <p>David did not focus on the problem. He saw it for what it was, reality -just like anything else in this world- and instead of focusing on the rough
      waters in his way, he looked past this situation. He directed his family to not lose sight of the rock. His higher Self, guided by Love for his family,
      discovered an opportunity for safety.</p>
      <p>People like David don't focus on the problem. Successful people focus on what's more important to them: either the obstacles or the things waiting
      for them past the obstacles. Leaders, true leaders, do not see problems as mere problems; we see them as opportunities. We recognize that the usage of
      of the word depends on our perspective, and we choose not to cause cortisol levels to rise in everyone else if it is not necessary. We recognize that when
      entrusted as a Leader, we must choose to follow our Higher Selves' behaviors and actions. We must choose to wear a perspective not from the naysayers and
      complainers. We must choose a perspective that empowers us.</p>
