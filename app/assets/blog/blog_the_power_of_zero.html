    <h1>Zero</h1>

    <h2>What Do You Think of When You See Zero?</h2>
    <p>Many people would tell me they think of nothing, emptiness, nada.</p>
    <p>Few would give a different answer and ask if that was the answer I was looking for.</p>
    <p>And even fewer were concerned about what I thought about their answer. This
    crowd captivated me the most because whether or not they gave a common answer, they
    were not concerned about my response.</p>
    <p>However, when it was my turn to share, I genuinely hoped not to convince them of
    what I thought about when I saw the number zero, but rather entrusted that I would
    somehow inpsire them because of the wisdom learned. </p>
    <p>A lot of these people, when asked the question, had a common mentality. A mentality I
    choose to not declare as my own anymore. It was a limited way of thinking. I don't blame them
    for they may never have known what having a freer, open mind is. I myself, was in their position
    until one day, I literally had enough of feeling close-minded, powerless, helpless, and restricted.
    I chased knowledge like it was my food and water after spending days in the scorching desert of
    nothingness.</p>
    <p>A desert of nothingness...</p>
    <p>I felt a surge of power emante through and from me. This realization that I was held accountable for
    this feeling and responsible for everything that I do and think, including thoughts that interpreted this
    desert to offer nothing.</p>
    <p>I laugh everytime I share what I think about the number zero. I listen intently to other people when they
    answer the question and empathize with them when they feel miserable. But when they begin to see me smile,
    they ask me the question with confused curiosity. </p>
    <p>And I answer wholeheartedly...</p>
    <p>When I think of the number zero, I do not think of nothing or emptiness like I used to. That is a perspective
    I choose not to wear anymore because it does not encourage me to be my truest Self full of character and Love.
    When I think of or see the number zero, I think of opportunity. I don't see it as nada; I see it as infinite room
    for something else. It has turned into a symbol of growth for me.</p>
    <p>There have been plenty of times when I have fallen and felt powerless, saw that I had no power in me, and therefore,
    considered it to be an unwanted number. Yet, when I chose to stop complaining -when I chose to leave the zero moments
    behind me- I realized that it was only like this that I began to honestly add value to my life.</p>
    <p>See, when you place a number zero in front of a digit, no matter how many zeroes you place in front of that digit,
    if we choose to continue to see these moments of nothingness and complain, the digit remains the same; no value is added.
    </p>
    <p>But when we recognize that these moments of nothingness are rather an opportunity for something novel, something worthy
    to learn from, and we stop complaining to instead engage presently, we place that number zero behind our digit. Our digit
    changes from a single digit into a double digit, into a triple digit, and so forth.</p>
    <p>The power of zero adds value to my character now. </p>
    <p>Ever since I felt the value of the number zero, my appreciation for moments that are supposed to make me feel like I have nothing,
    has amplified exponentially!</p>
    <p>I remember feeling at my lowest when I found myself dreading to get out of bed because it felt like I had nothing to live for.
    I felt like everything I had known was gone, ripped away from my grasp. I remember loathfully completing my tasks, periodically and hysterically
    convincing myself with a smile as fake as the one scarred on Jokers face, declaring that I was doing fantastic! And once 6PM struck, my body would want to enclose, my mind
    thought of nothing else but my bed, and my heart would not stop aching. I would hurry on home and try to cover the pain with sleep.</p>
    <p>The mental recovery was slow. I was never like this. In fact, before this last downfall, I was always the gogetter. It was difficult to try to
    relate to this past version of myself because at least he had something to live for. And this is where part of my realization took place: I was
    looking to the past for answers because it felt like my future had nothing to offer. Nothing!!???</p>
    <p>NOTHING??!!</p>
    <p>You stupid fuck! This is not the true you! This is not your thought!</p>
    <p>You are someone who has always made something out of nothing! What do you mean your future has absolutely nothing!?? Stop looking at the past for answers. What matters now is
    you place it all behind you and focus on the present!</p>
    <p>Wake up! You are using everyone's definition of nothing! Use your own like Rumplestiltskin did!</p>
    <p>The Power of Zero doesn't mean a finite nothing. It means an INFINITE realm of OPPORTUNITY! </p>
    <p>Yes, it comes with pain, but so does regret, and listen closely:
      <br>
      I would rather have pain to learn from than to forever yearn from. </p>
