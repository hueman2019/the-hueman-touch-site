  <h1>Biology of Success</h1>

    <h2>We Are Equipped for Success</h2>
    <p> When it comes to our bodies, the general rule is "Use It! Or Lose It!"</p>
    <p>And I love to break it to you: that same rule applies emotionally,
      mentally, and spiritually! Lucky for us, Mother Nature equipped us with
      the tools we need to continue using our muscles and memory so that we do
      not lose what is important to us!</p>
    <p>Evolutionarily speaking, we have been granted these tools for our mere
      survival. We are social animals, and yet, did more than just survive. We live to
      create meaning in our lives, chase dreams, and create revolutionary changes in
      the world. But what exactly are these tools?</p>
    <p>They are: <strong>dopamine</strong>, <strong>oxytocin</strong>, and <strong>
        serotonin</strong>.</p>
    <p>We are in charge of producing all of these, but one of them is the selfish chemical. I'll tell you why:</p>
    <h4>DOPAMINE</h4>
    <p>Dopamine is the sense of pleasure you get from accomplishment. It's that rush you get when you win! YES!!!
      When you accomplish a goal! TOUCHDOWN!! When you find what you were looking for! YESS!!! YESS!!! YESS!!! It is
      the chemical in our brains responsible for this feeling.</p>
    <p>Evolutionarily speaking, Mother Nature provided this sense of accomplishment to motivate us to find another
      meal the next day. This chemical made us feel pleasure when we ate, mated, and slept. Of course if it feels good,
      why not do it again??</p>
    <p>The reason it is called the Selfish Chemical is because we do not need anyone else to create it.</p>

    <p>We can easily create it by going out for a run or crossing things off our to-do list. A little story I would like to share:</p>
    <p>I grew this habit of writing a to-do list every day and crossing the items off as I go. One time, I was in such a
      rush that I completely forgot to write down the list. When I completed the tasks of the day, it felt like
      something was missing. Then it hit me that I forgot to write the to-do list for the day. I immediately write the list
      and with a smurk on my face, cross them off right after I had just got done writing them. It was the DOPAMINE!! This sense
      of pleasure that I wanted!!</p>
    <p>This is why its called the Selfish Chemical. We do not need anyone else to create it.</p>
    <h4>OXYTOCIN</h4>
    <p>Also known as the chemical of <a href="love_a_diction.html">Love</a>, is needed for success.</p>
    <div class="imagecontainer">
      <div class="chemicalimage">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>It is responsible for the feelings of rainbows and butterflies, the love and trust we feel with the our loved ones. </p>
    <p>If we did not trust and love the people we live with, we would not ever feel safe being around them. We would not be able
    to thrive. Evolutionarily speaking, if we were not able to trust the people we slept with, and danger came knocking on the door
    unexpectedly, we would not have survived as a species. If we did not trust the people we slept and dined with, we would always
    be on the lookout, thus increasing our levels of stress and fatigue, which in turn decreases our chance for survival. </p>

    <p>The feeling a mother gets when she gives birth to children is a rush of oxytocin coursing through her body, as she embraces the
    beautiful creature with love and care. She would do anything to protect that child because she LOVES this child!</p>
    <p>Mother Nature equipped us with this chemical responsible for Trust and Love so that we can protect each other and care for each other!</p>
    <p>However, we need interdependence to get a dose of this feeling. We need one another.</p>
    <p>In fact, by doing kind acts for someone else increases the levels of oxytocin in our system. And no, I do not mean giving money away. I mean
    genuine, kind acts that require something we will not get back: effort and time.</p>
    <p>I remember one day, on my commute back home, there was this fellow on the train who was having a hard time with all his luggage. I was quite some
    distance away from him, and I saw how he struggled, yet people would not stop to give a second of their time to help. I immediately got up to lend him a
    hand. It only took a minute of my life to assist, and his gratitude increased my levels of oxytocin: I felt great! In fact, witnessing acts of kindness
    also increase the levels of oxytocin because as I headed back to my seat, an elder lady stopped me in my tracks to say: "That was really kind of you, young
    man. I feel good to know that people like you exist."</p>
    <p>Two complete strangers, and yet multiple magnifying and exponential shots of oxytocin dispersed between them, I... and, whoever else witnessed this.</p>
    <p>This feeling is the reason why we can trust Leaders whenever they commit acts of kindness. We become touched, inspired, MOTIVATED to do the same.</p>
    <p>Without this chemical responsible for these feelings, we would not be able to one, survive, and two, thrive.</p>
    <p>Oxytocin connnects us, and to top it off, it is also responsible for protecting and enhancing our immune system. We become healthier and directed away from
    Dopamine's potential dangers of addiction. We don't want to engage in harmful activities, we Trust where we are because we developed these feelings of Trust and Love,
    and extended them to our close ones. Trust is developed because deep down, we want to feel safe, and when we feel safe, we do not act against the well-being of ourselves.
    We are not led by fear, and thus we do not commit acts of fear that serve only the best interests of ourselves.</p>
    <p>Oxytocin is necessary in our lives. It is necessary for success because we are led by Trust and Love!</p>

    <h4>SEROTONIN</h4>
    <p>Perhaps my favorite of all, the Leadership Chemical.</p>

    <p>It is not easy to be a Leader for it requires giving time and effort to the people around us, and we know that it is impossible to give everyone these two important
    gifts. However, a True Leader is one who recognizes the strengths in others and helps develop and enhance them, so that <strong>THEY</strong> can become Leaders.</p>
    <p>A Leader is someone who creates, not followers, but more Leaders. And the best way to do this is by giving something invaluable to the people around us: Time and effort
    mixed attentively into something called recognition!</p>
    <p>Some of us know this as positive reinforcement, some of us know this as reward. I see it as simple Human Recognition.</p>
    <p>As children, we don't really care whether we know we are misbehaving. All we want to be is the center of everyone's eyes. And if we do not get that attention, we begin
    to instinctively act in ways that will certainly catch the attention of the people we want to bond with. This feeling is a primal instinct to be recognized for who we are.
    Our jobs as Leaders in this world is to correct their behavior. But what does this require? Time, effort, attention... Human Recognition.</p>
    <p>If we want to raise the metrics in a business, we approach the people we are in charge of, who are in charge of their people responsible for the metrics... And we give
    them this beautiful thing called Human Recognition. If we are doing an excellent job, we want to genuinely thank them for all their hard work. If we are struggling to get
    the results we want, we approach them, give them our time, effort, and attention, and empathically ask: "Are you ok?"</p>
    <p>Human Recognition extends far beyond the scope of positive reinforcement. It extends far beyond rewards. It taps into what makes us Human. It taps into all the things we
    do to make our lives meaningful.</p>
    <p>Even as adults we need this sense of Human Recognition! Why do you think we hold ceremonies and celebrations?! How would you feel if the University you attended, the one
    that consisted of years of hard work, long nights, memorable times and people -all these sacrifices and rewarding moments- congratulated you via e-mail and asked you to print your
    degree at home!? When we walk across the stage and receive our degree, we especially wish to see the people who supported us. We yearn to be recognized for our accomplishments,
    for who we are, for our efforts.</p>
    <p>And the best part of Human Recognition is that it adds to our levels of confidence. Serotonin is largely at work here. When we feel confident, we empower
    ourselves to be Leaders. Because, again, how do Leaders feel? Confident. This is why I refer to it as the Leadership Chemical. It is the one that empowers ourselves <strong>by empowering others</strong>.</p>
    <p>True Leadership emerges when we know how to grow habits that healthily provide us with the Dopamine we need to continue making an impact in this world. True Leadership requires
    Empathy, something born from the presence of Trust and Love, which Oxytocin is responsible for.</p>
    <p>When our habits are founded and driven by the forces of Trust and Love, our True Leadership touches the hearts of the people we meet in our lives. Our actions cross the chasm, and along the way creates ripple
    effects for the improvements we would like to create in this world. Most importantly, our Leadership will continue to honor, preserve, and empower the essence of all meaning:
    our Human Spirit.</p>
