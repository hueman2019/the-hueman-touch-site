          Improvement is always better. A maxim we can definitely agree on. But we all reach the top of the mountain from different angles and directions. Our backgrounds differ, and thus, so do our personalities and motives. Yet, somewhere in the
          concentration of diverse cultures and motivation,Â  the word "enough" has turned into a powerful force of action.

          "Enough" is only enough with objective parameters that define it, and with measures that meet its exact standards, such as receiving no change when buying your favorite drinks. As anything treated subjectively, it instantly becomes a mysterious
          mover. <br><br>
          However, what I noticed is that many of us have a mindset that enough is never enough, or we lie to ourselves, claiming that we have enough, yet find ourselves splurging or seeking something more because of that void we feel. The
          drive to take action is fueled by this sense of inadequacy in some area in our lives.
          <br><br>

          The word "improvement" has an effect on this sense of inadequacy because we all want to make room for improvement in our lives at some level, yet improvement implies that the current quality or quantity of the content is not enough to meet
          the level of quality or quantity "bettering" requires.
          <br><br>

          So the paradoxical question is: How do we appreciate what we have, yet seek improvement, without inflicting this sense of inadequacy or emptiness unto our minds?
          <br><br>
          The answer? 
          <br><br>
          We appreciate what we have in the moment and we face the truth. If we feel empty it is because we are empty.
          <br><br>
          <h3>Human Nature's Necessities</h3>
          The truth is, it is Human Nature to want more, and what I mean by this is that we seek a higher purpose. Many of us go off into Life without knowing what our higher
          purpose is and thus, we lead unfulfilling lives. The first step in living a much more fulfilling life is to recognize the existence of this hunger in our Human Spirit.
          <br><br>
          This hunger longs for Human core needs, such as safety/survival, satisfaction, and sociability. We want to make sure we feel safe and are able to survive in the environment
          we find ourselves in. We also want to feel satisfied with the quality of our life, but this is the area many of us struggle with because of how idiosyncratic our experiences are.
          In addition to this, we want to feel part of something bigger than ourselves, whether we are <a href="#">introverted or extroverted</a>, by connecting with others.

          <br><br>

          The next step is in determining whether a sense of inadequacy exists as a motivating factor or a deterring factor.
          <br><br>
          <h3>The Two Variations</h3>
          If you use this sense of inadequacy as a motivating factor, you are already one step ahead towards a more fulfilling life, although not in the direction you would think you would like.
          We tend to use this sense as fuel -sometimes we even bully ourselves so much the inner fighter comes out to kick ass and take names. If this method works for you, and you do not wish to change it,
          then good for you and by all means continue to use it. However, be wary that the subconscious mind acts on behalf of what it hears -of what you believe. It may get you what you want
          for short term goals, but on the long run, the brain will be trained to think that the self is lacking, insufficient, and thus result dipping back into this cycle of inadequacy.
          <br><br>
          If you use this sense of inadequacy as a deterring factor, you most likely tend to justify that your life is more fulfilling by avoiding things that are considered dangerous, unwanted, taboo, or
          unnecessary. Your Soul says: "I FEEL EMPTY!" but you say: "At least I have my wife and kids." While I encourage you to value your family, I also encourage you to not come from the direction of seeking
          refuge from this sense of insufficiency. On the contrare, realize that this sense exists and choose to not run away from it. Feel its totality. The pain of feeling like complete dirt sucks, but that is
          the reality of Life at times. We are not born perfect.
          <br><br>

          <h3>The Substitution</h3>
          Once we identify whether we've used inadequacy as either a motivating or deterring factor in our lives, it becomes much easier to pinpoint the sources that we initially thought best work for us, and replace
          them with a much simpler thought:
          <br><br>
          <blockquote>
          "I feel <strong>I am enough</strong> and <strong>for that same reason</strong>, I must continue to seek improvement in certain areas of my life because there is <strong>always</strong> room for <strong>happiness</strong>."
          </blockquote>
          <br><br>

          This sense of inadequacy is a message sent to us in the society we live in today. With media and technology in almost every direction, not only are we exposed to an excessive amount of information, but much of
          this information endorses the desire for "more". Isn't it ironic that the psychology of advertising is <em>"Less is More"</em> (making quick, short ads that entice the viewers attention), yet the effect it has
          on many of us is quite the opposite, where we feel an urge to have more to replace this sense of "-lessness"? While ads endorse this desire for more, much of these things offered are not suited for our higher purpose -and this
          is exactly where and when we begin to lose ourselves and/or our satisfaction for Life.
          <br><br>
          <br>
          As mentioned before, we have three core needs as a Human Being: they are <em>survival</em>, <em>satisfaction</em>, and <em>sociability</em>. In this era, suriving seems to be easier with civilization rather than having to worry about
          attacks from invaders or predators. Satisfaction is idiosyncratic, and thus different for everyone; no one experience will be exactly the same experience for another person. With this said, it is important to remember that the important
          rule for having a great quality of life is to be <strong>mindful</strong> of your experiences and take action upon them.
