  <h1>Shift Plus 1</h1>
  <h3>By: HECTOR PEREZ</h3>

  <article class="">
    <h2>!</h2>
    <p>The beautiful combination of these two keys pressed
      together create a symbol of remarkable grace
      and power. They raise the
      tone you use in your head when you find its
      presence in the text you read. The creation adds emphasis!</p>

    <p> However, this symbol created isn't simply an exclamation mark.
      This symbol lives up to its name because it encapsulates and grants
      grace and power to the statement that precedes it. </p>

    <p>Wouldn't you like to invigorate your life with grace and power to
      actions and events that precede you? How?</p>

      <p>In a similar fashion, when you add emphasis to your mindset! When you
      live life with an emphatic conviction so pure and strong, you make your
      impact, your legacy known!!</p>

      <p>When you empower your mind with: realizing that motivation is always a choice;
      That how we respond to situations is always a choice; Realizing that emotions are
      always a choice; and that we can always find a choice embedded in our Human Spirit...
      that is when we add emphasis to our Life to achieve our greatest desires!</p>

      <p>One thing must be made clear, though. The point of adding emphasis is to ignite and
      extend ardor into the vast emptiness of time and space. Adding emphasis to certain tasks
      indeed may help accomplish them, but the shift plus one mindset was not meant for finite
      goals.</p>

      <p>That's what the period is for. Making statements and moving on to the next one.</p>
      <p>No. What we want to do is keep going! We want to make it known that our essence is here
      to leave a mark!</p>

      <!-- Would you not rather than
      wake up and view yourself as an aging, rotting human
      being, instead see yourself for what you really are:
      a human being with a beautiful Soul like that of a
      flower's? Where instead of aging, every day you
      grow younger because just like a flower blossoms
      newer petals, you acquire new experiences? </p> -->

    <p>
      And so, the key to living the Life we highly desire to live
      is determining what kind of goals we set ourselves. Are they short-term or are they long-term?
      Do we want to make a statement or a declaration? In other words, are our goals finite or infinite?
    </p>

    <p>
      Short term and long term goals make us feel great
      when they are accomplished. And that is exactly
      the point! They equip us with the sense of
      achievement that builds confidence -it's the rush of Dopamine we give to
      ouurselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      These kinds of goals are finite. They can be
      achieved within a deadline and they drive us to accomplish them within that given window of
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet, this is where many people lose their ardor, their emphasis. </p>
      <p>
      The problem with most people when they set out for their goals on either the short term or long term,
      is that once they accomplish them, their motivation becomes drained in the vacuum of glory. They meet
      their goals, but the reason for starting out in the first place, becomes warped into a sense of
      overly celebrated moments and entitlement that lead to less executions of the practices the journey required.
    </p>

    <p>It's like working out. People go to the gym and once they get the results they want, they stop going to the
      gym. What? No. You have to keep going! You have to make it a lifestyle if you want to look good and/or stay
      in shape! People tend to live their lives, embarking on many goals with a statement ending in a period. And once they
      reach the end of that statement, that period marks the end of their ambition.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, probably full of calluses, when you make room in your life for infinite goals -when you Shift plus
        1 your reasons to Live, Love, Laugh, and Leave a Legacy- you could feel the ultimate source of your purpose seamlessly
        and powerfully pull you, which, without a doubt, works in your favor to get you closer to accomplishing your goals with
        grace and power! </p>

    <p>Empower your ambitions, your motives for doing the things you set out to do in a fashion that keeps you going!
    </p>

    <p>Shift plus 1 the reason why you choose to be a
      better boss! <br>
      Shift plus 1 the reason why you choose to be a <br>
      more caring husband and provider for your family! <br>
      Shift plus 1 the reason why you choose to start
      that business you've always dreamed of! <br>
      Shift plus 1 the reason, especially when you are
      feeling too tired or lazy, to work out! <br>
      Shift plus 1 the reason why you wake up in the
      morning! <br>
      Shift plus 1 your fuckin Life, yo! Seriously.</p>

      <p>And if you have not caught on to the main message here, honestly, there is nothing left for me to say. It's simple: </p>
      <p>
      We can either choose to live our lives without emphasis and nothing but mundane statements, <strong>OR</strong> we can choose to live our
      lives passionately, vigorously, full of grace and power, piercing through reality with the edge we sharpened with the Love we have for Life
      and our Legacy. </p>
