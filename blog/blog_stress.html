        Life is about Perspective.
        <br>
        While many of my peers panicked, I've spent my college life believing that stress was "non-existent". Every time there would be a pop quiz or it was the day of an accumulative exam, I would feel excited. Even on days that I did not study for
        them, I confided more in my abilities than on the worry. When my peers would grow anxious, I would encourage my friends and colleagues that tests were not a reason to lose a grip of emotional stability. I saw them debilitate and get sick
        frequently and knew that stress was taking a toll on them. I did not want to experience what they experienced so it became more of a motivator to believe that stress in my life was "non-existent."
        <br>
        However, while this belief helped me get through college, my mindset of facing difficulties had been subtly training itself to avoid them in the guise of focusing on the brighter side. See, to discredit a situation as being "stressful" would
        also discredit my ability to handle the stress involved, and this way of thinking was harmful to personal growth. I would blindly miss opportunities to strengthen problem-solving skills. I <a href="detrimental_cycle_of_negativity_on_brain.html">reacted to stress detrimentally</a>.
        <br>
        We are taught that stress is always, extremely harmful. Science, whether unconsciously or not, threw stones at "cortisol" and this created a huge mudslide across the media and companies imploring us to take action to reduce stress via ads and
        products. Of course anything in extreme amounts may have destabilizing effects, but this stigma demands <em><strong>we get rid of stress by separating ourselves from it instead of acknowledging it and using the opportunity to exercise our character. 
        </strong></em>
        <br>
        Our outlook on stress matters..
        Stress is not always harmful. Stress is a biological response preparing us for a situation requiring much effort and attention for a meaningful acquisition, whether it is objective, subjective, or both. And it is not a "bad" thing our bodies
        react this way. It releases cortisol and DHEA (S), important steroid hormones involved in memory and learning processes. If these two hormones are involved in these processes then, surely, there must be a golden opportunity to catalyze a
        stressful situation into learning experiences! Plenty of times we've been told that extreme levels of cortisol has neurotoxic effects that harm the hippocampus, but how often do we hear that DHEA (S) has a counter -and balancing- effect on
        cortisol?

          alt="" width="0" height="0" border="0" />", Kelly McGonigal beautifully clarifies how our perception towards stress affects us:
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        “The ratio of DHEA to cortisol is called the growth index of a stress response.  A higher growth index—meaning more DHEA—helps people thrive under stress.  It predicts academic persistence and resilience in
        college students, as well as higher GPAs.  During military survival training, a higher growth index is associated with greater focus, less dissociation, and superior problem-solving skills, as well as few post-traumatic stress symptoms
        afterward…
        <br>
        Crum wanted to see if changing people’s perceptions of stress could modify this measure of resilience.
        <br>
        Could a three-minute video about stress alter this key ratio of stress hormones?
        <br>
        <strong>The answer amazingly, is yes.</strong>
        <br>
        The videos had no effect on cortisol levels.  Everyone’s cortisol went up during the mock interview, as expected.  However, participants who had watched the stress-is-enhancing video before the interview released
        more DHEA and had a higher growth index than participants who had watched the stress-is-debilitating video.  Viewing stress as enhancing made it so—not in some subjective, self-reported way, but in the ratio of stress hormones produced by
        the participants’ adrenal glands.  Viewing stress as helpful created a different biological reality.”
        <br>
        <br>
        The outlook that stress is harmful can actually be more harmful on the long run than the actual short-term effects stress lays upon us. So the next time you find yourself in a stressful situation, remember to put on your optimistic
        spectacles
        and view the situation more clearly. Once you befriend stress and acknowledge that it is there to help you solve your problems, ask yourself what can you learn from the situation?
